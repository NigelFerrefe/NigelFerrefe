## 👨‍💻 About Me  
I am a web developer with experience in digital design and creativity. My background in **History** and a **Master's in Digital Humanities** from the University of Barcelona have given me a unique perspective to approach projects from a critical and multidisciplinary angle.  

Currently, as a student at **Ironhack**, I specialize in **frontend development** using technologies such as **React.js** and **JavaScript**, creating dynamic and user-centered applications.  

My passion for technology began with **3D modeling**, and that experience has allowed me to excel in the creation of visually attractive and functional interfaces. I seek to combine my creativity with technical skills to develop innovative digital solutions and continue growing as a professional in the world of web development.
